# QuestCord

QuestCord is a bot and gamemaster, otherwise known as **Quest Lord**. **Quest Lord** brings users into the cruel world of *Discordia* as characters and immerses those characters in a quest. With a little bit of luck and skill, and a lot of Discord engagement, the party can overcome the challenges they face and become stronger, or they can die and join *Discordia's* ever-growing list of casualties.

## engaging users

- a server mod can manually start a quest for a group of users
- if a group of users are talking, QL might start a quest for them
- if a group is in VC, QL might start a quest for them

## creating characters

- once users are added to a quest, they will be prompted to create characters
- the only choice presented to the user is the class
- once all characters are created, the quest begins

## starting a quest

- a quest will start with a basic combat encounter
- this will teach most of the game's mechanics

## random encounters

- random encounters occur when users engage with the server
- the more users in the party that are involved, the greater the chance an encounter will occur
