# QuestCord (working title)

QuestCord is a bot and gamemaster, otherwise known as **Quest Lord**. **Quest Lord** brings users into the cruel world of *Discordia (working title)* as characters and immerses those characters in a quest. With a little bit of luck and skill, and a lot of Discord engagement, the party can overcome the challenges they face and become stronger, or they can die and join *Discordia's* ever-growing list of casualties.
